## Website Operating System _WSOS_  ##


This is again a random idea that I had while doing other random stuff.

The basic idea is a OS based on HTML5/CSS3/JS and PHP as the machine behind the whole thing.

The basic idea is almost no storage for devices. Everything is in the cloud. Also the main part of the OS. Programs and things like that are driven and stored from the cloud. This can be perfectly posible with modern CSS3 and HTML5.

The main idea behind this is customization. I the user be able to customize the whole UI. Also functions. He is able to customize everything. The only limit will be what the machine Admin gives up.

## Think here by about things like ##
- On server RAM usage.
- php cache usage.
- on machine storage usage.
- bandwidth usage.

## Program Installs ##

I was thinking how you want to do program installs? Well that is quite simple in my mind for now. Just upload/drop a PHP file in a folder. And it's done. The first time using it might take a while because possible databases need to be installed/configured But after that it should be done!
